# Changelog

I will do my best to keep this up to date with significant changes here, starting in 0.8.3.

## master

* No longer defaulting uuid to new instance, use :default instead. This allows for nil values for attributes of uuid type.

## 0.14.0

* No longer persisting nil attributes
* Added Toy::Types::JSON for storing serialized JSON as an attribute value
* Added #persisted_id and made it public so people can override confidently. It is now used in adapter.write and adapter.delete.
* Made #persist method public so people can override confidently.
* Moved Identity to Toy::Store from Toy::Object

## 0.13.0

* Update to adapter 0.7.0
* Removed .get_multi
* Change read multiple methods to take array with options.
* Allow passing options to read methods
* Added rails model/scaffold generators
* Delegate #to_key to key factory. Allows non-Stringish ids to work with to_key.
* Removed plugins
* Removed Toy.clear and Toy.reset

## 0.12.0

* Ruby 1.9 only. Officially not supporting Ruby 1.8.x.
* Added :native_uuid key factory for using when your data store supports them.
* Aliased .find and .read to .get.
* Aliased .find_multiple and .read_multiple to .get_multiple.

## 0.10.x => 0.11.0

* Added get_multiple which returns Hash of id pointed at instance.
